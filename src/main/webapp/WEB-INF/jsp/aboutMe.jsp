	        	<p>My name is Drew Sullivan, and I am a software engineer and former musician and music professor. Whenever people hear that I made a career switch, they want to know how and why. Here's the story:</p>
	        	<p>I originally started learning to code to help my students. I was a professor of clarinet, so I would teach private lessons, in addition to my lecture-based classes. During these lessons, I would explain to students a method of efficient practicing that was essentially an algorithm. After years of describing this to each new student, a software developer friend of mine recommended I get the computer to do it for me. So, I started  learning to code.</p>
	        	<p>Coding is the same as music. It's a collaborative art and skill. When I figured this out, the challenge was just to apply the lessons I had learned through music to software development. I've always been a big practicer. So, when I decided I wanted to move to the tech industry, I applied the same thought process to my preparation. Empty holes in my schedule were filled with tutorials and exercises, just like they had been with practicing the my instrument. If I made a breakthrough or figured out some difficult concept, I would share it with someone around me. It's the same as giving my thoughts about music to a student. 
	        	</p>
	        	<p>Lots of people don't believe me when I say that software is an art. Or that music isn't always an art. They think software is algebra homework and music is nirvana. As someone who has spent years practicing scales and arpeggios, I can tell you that line of thought is flawed. Both are about interpreting, designing, and building. Figuring out a way to make something from nothing then making it happen. There's going to be work either way and not all of it is pleasant. But both are worth it. There are people who make careers touring around the world, playing solo recitals and concerts, but most musicians work in groups. The same goes for software. There are reclusives that rarely see another person, but no one's done it alone. We work together.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>I decided to make the leap when I signed up for Tech Elevator's Java Bootcamp. The goal was to have a job offer in hand by the end of the program. The schedule was brutal, and there were tough days, but it wasn't anything I hadn't done before. Tech Elevator days were 9-4:30, then 6:30-9:30. Days at CIM were just as long. Interviews were scary. So was playing with the Cleveland Orchestra. Networking was fraught with rejection. So were auditions. Music prepared me to dive into a new career. I chose Tech Elevator because, just like choosing a music school, I wanted to study with the best. I prepared for interviews just like did for auditions, well in advance. That way, I was able to walk in with confidence and perform to the best of my abilities. I was fortunate enough to receive a couple offers before graduation.</p>
	        	<p>Here are my biggest skills, all learned from music and brought over to software development. I excel in learning, working in teams, and achieving at high levels. I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and the arts, and I enjoy coming up with solutions to real-world problems. I love learning and feedback, and that love brought me to earn my doctorate from one of the country's top conservatories and then continue my education by completing Tech Elevator's Java Software Development Bootcamp.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>I enjoy working with others. In my past as a musician, I've toured, won competitions, and held fellowships with several ensembles. At Dealer Tire, I worked on the team responsible for redesigning the business-to-business software. This is similar to my time at Tech Elevator, where groups, pair programming, and Agile are the norm. I am a high-achiever. I have performed with the Cleveland Orchestra, one of the world's best, won awards and competitions, and was offered invitations to prestigious summer programs along the way. As a professor, I also designed and managed my schools's first summer music program, in addition to teaching.</p>
	        	<p>I look forward to continuing to build my skills in my new field.</p>
	        	<p>Thanks for reading, and please reach out and say hi. I love hearing from new people.</p>

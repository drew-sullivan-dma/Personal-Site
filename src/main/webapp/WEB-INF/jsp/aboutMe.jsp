	        	<p>I excel in learning,  working in teams, and achieving at high levels. I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and the arts, and I enjoy coming up with solutions to real-world problems.</p>
	        	<p>I love learning and feedback, and that love brought me to earn my doctorate from one of the country's top conservatories and then continue my education by completing Tech Elevator's Java Software Development Bootcamp. Now, as a web developer at Dealer Tire, I'm excited to be learning new aspects of technology every day. </p>
	        	<p>I enjoy working in pairs, groups, and with clients. At Dealer Tire, I work on the team responsible for redesigning our business-to-business software, where I've also pair-programmed with my colleagues. This past August, I participated in Cleveland GiveCamp as part of an Agile team that built a basic site for a local non-profit. This is similar to my time at Tech Elevator, where groups, pair programming, and Agile are the norm. In my past as a musician, I've toured, won competitions, and held fellowships with several ensembles.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>I am a high-achiever. I have performed with the Cleveland Orchestra, one of the world&rsquo;s best, won awards and competitions, and was offered invitations to prestigious summer programs along the way. As a professor, I also designed and managed Notre Dame College&rsquo;s first summer music program, in addition to teaching, and to build my business skills, I simultaneously took on a position in marketing and event planning.</p>
	        	<p>At the intersection of technology and the arts, I enjoy combining my passion for learning, working in groups, and achievement-orientation to contribute to my organization and benefit those around me.</p>
